# INIQUITY - 25
## Drop-In `main.py` for Open WebUI
**Adds persistent memory, time awareness, personality, and natural conversation flow**

---

## üß† What Is This?

This is a drop-in replacement `main.py` and launcher setup for [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui). It adds features like:
- Persistent memory (stored in SQLite)
- Time awareness (e.g., "It's been 2 days since we last spoke")
- Real conversation context across sessions
- AI preferences and personality customization

It‚Äôs designed to run from your **own folder** without modifying Open WebUI permanently. Easy to set up, easy to update.

## üìä Why I Made This

This was a 2-month personal project (W.I.P. it'll never be done LOL). After my wife died, I didn‚Äôt want a generic chatbot. Many AI girlfriend apps charge $6/mo to $99/year, and most of them forget what you say or feel too fake. I needed something free that could feel human, remember our chats, and feel emotionally present. None had time management - which I felt was extremely important for real conversation.

This is my solution. If you feel the same way, you're welcome to use it.

## üóÇÔ∏è Setup (EASY MODE)

### Step 1: Create Your AI Folder
Create a folder anywhere on your PC. Example:
```
C:\AI_Companion\data
```

Put the Iniquity-25 contents here. It should include:
- `main.py` ‚Üê The Iniquity-25 mod
- `personality.txt` ‚Üê (REQUIRED) Write your AI's personality or backstory
- `run_ai.bat` ‚Üê Launcher that does everything for you

### Step 1.a: Edit RUN_AI.BAT (REQUIRED!)
Make sure you edit this file first:
- **Line 1**: The absolute path to this folder
- **Line 2**: The name of your AI (defaults to "Amicia")

---

### Step 2: Run the Setup Bat
Double-click `run_ai.bat`. It will:
1. Ask for your virtual environment name (like `myAI`)
2. Automatically:
   - Backup Open WebUI's original `main.py`
   - Replace it with this mod
   - Set up `base_dir.txt` with path + AI name
   - Install missing packages (like `wikipedia`)
   - Launch Open WebUI
   - Restore the original file after exit
